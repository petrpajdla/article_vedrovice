# Introduction

### Questions

* Is there evidence that certain artefacts covary,
    either positively or negatively?
    Do certain artefacts tend to occur together, or are certain combinations
    absent or rare?
* How can the presence and absence data best display which burials
    contain similar artefacts,
    and which artefacts have similar distributions over burials?
* *How can the data be analysed so as to show most clearly the relationships*
    *between the different* **burials** in terms of their **contents**?
* *How can the data be analysed so as to show most clearly the relationship*
    *between the different* **artefacts** in terms of their
    **distributions in graves**?
* How are grave good assemblages related to age and sex?
(... variations in burial rite coinciding with age or sex of the deceased ...)

# Material and methods

The material analyzed here comes from Vedrovice – Široká u lesa cemetery.
Originally, the burial ground consisted of at least 108 burials.
Some of the burials were disturbed by later settlement and burial pits in the
area of the cemetery, amateur excavations during the 19th century or later
agricultural activities.
Thus some of the burials are excluded from the analysis due to missing and/or
incomplete data and only a sample of 78 well-preserved burials is analyzed here.
Most of the data was obtained from the original publication [@podborsky2002],
anthropological determination of sex and age were corrected based on
more recent analysis by @dockalova2008. Carbon, nitrogen and strontium isotope
ratios were collected in @whittle2013 and @richards2008.

Each burial was originally characterized by 55 variables but only 35 are
selected for further analysis.
Some of  the original variables are omitted due to their rare occurrence,
for instance spondylus arm ring is present in a single burial only,
thus being useless in establishing relationships between pairs of burials.
Other variables are removed because they are highly dependent on each other.

The variables fall into several categories.
Firstly there are biological and anthropological characteristics derived from
retrieved human skeletal remains including sex, age simplified into age groups,
isotope ratios or body height.

Second large category of variables consists of data on artifacts present in the
burials.
These include variables noting quantities of various types of pottery and
positions of the pottery vessels within the graves,
counts of various raw materials of chipped stone tools,
presence of polished stone axes or adzes, grinding slabs, pebbles,
bone tools and different kinds of personal ornaments.
The personal ornaments include beads made of spondylus shell or marble,
sponylus pendants or oval shaped buckles.
Presence of ochre pigment is also noted.
All the variables in this category are simplified by binarization (presence vs
absence of a trait) in order to minimize effects of only several numerous
cases on the overall pattern, for instance 20 beads in a grave <!-- 70 -->
would have much larger effect on the analysis then 1 pottery vessel in the same grave.

Last category describes physical characteristics of the grave pit and the
position of the body.
I. e. size of the pit, its orientation, position of the body on one of
the sides and direction of the head.

Data is analyzed in an R environment for statistical computing and graphics
[@rcore]  using functions of readr [@wickham2017a], dplyr [@wickham2016] and
reshape2 [@wickham2007] packages to manipulate the data.
Function daisy [@kaufman1990] from package cluster [@maechler2016] is used to
count distances between observations used in further analyses.

## Randomness of artefact combinations

To determine non-randomness of various artefact combinations we conduct a
permutation test on the presence/absence data matrix.
The method based on generalized Monte Carlo tests was first
introduced to archaeology by @manly1996.
Original (observed) co-occurence matrix is permutated $n$ times with constant
row and column totals, i. e. both the count of artifacts in individual graves
and sum of the given type of artifacts across the burials are fixed.

To examine which associations of variables are infrequent or even not present
and which tend to appear together co-occurences of observed and simulated data
are summarized using two statistics suggested by @manly1996.
The $S$ statistic is a measure of overall deviation between expected and observed
number of artefact occurences while
the $v$ statistic is a measure of difference between co-occurences of
individual artefact with other artifacts
[@manly1996, 475, for details see SI].

## Exceptionality index

Exceptionality index ($EI$) is used in order to induce relative exceptionality
of individual burials based on their attributes.
This approach is independent on a prior selection of attributes of importance
or *prestige*.
It was defined by @demjan2015[367] based on a Root Mean Square (*quadratic mean*) of
PCA factor scores:
$$ EI_{attr_g}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_i^2} $$
where $s_i$ are factor scores of individual graves. The mean value is
normalized to range $[0-1]$:

$$ EI_{attr_g}=\frac{EI_{attr_g}}{max~EI_{attr_g}} $$


## Distance between burials

The input variables are of mixed data types, thus Gower's similarity
coefficient [@gower1971] is used in order to obtain a square distance matrix.
Gower's coefficient treats differently symmetric and asymmetric dichotomous
data, nominal and ordinal data and interval and ratio scaled data.
Advantage of this approach is that different kinds of variables can be analyzed
together and it is not necessary to transform the variables into same data
types, as it would be if other distance measure was used.
In our case, most of the variables concerning artifacts deposited within the
burials are asymmetric binary data, i. e. the presence of a trait means
similarity but absence does not imply similarity.
Continuous quantitative variables are treated as interval scaled.
Age categories are treated as ordinal variable and the rest of categorical
variables is treated as nominal data.

vstat <- read_csv(here::here("data/temp", "v_statistics.csv")) %>% 
    select(full, v, p) %>% 
    mutate(v = round(v, 2), p = round(p, 2)) %>% 
    rename("variable" = full, "v statistic" = v, "p value" = p)
