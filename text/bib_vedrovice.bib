  abstract = {Archaeologists have often used their “eye” to interpret spatial patterns within cemetery sites. In this article, we will use Ripley’s K-function analysis to determine the proximity of statistically significant clusters within four early Anglo-Saxon cemetery sites: Wakerley, Norton, Berinsfield, and Lechlade. Using spatial and statistical methods supported by ArcGIS 10 we will explore the kernel density estimates of graves at the point of significance to discuss the organization of cemeteries as part of their chronological and social development. As a result of this investigation we will conclude that these sites were not organized into small clusters of nuclear family graves but large plots that contained the remains of varied, multivocational households. }

  abstract = {This article demonstrates the analytical potential of graph theory for understanding mortuary practices in past societies. We take advantage of social network analysis software PAJEK to model relationships among burials. The case study of the Early Bronze Age cemetery Rebešovice (Czech Republic) is used to explore the potential of the network approach to explain the contrast between the center and the periphery of the cemetery. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this      contrast:   Chronological and social. The first hypothesis explains the difference between the center and the periphery as an effect of social standing, while the latter as an effect of time. The data set includes archaeological and biological data from 72 burials. We calculate simple matching distance matrices as a measure of dissimilarity among the burials based on socially and chronologically significant variables and Euclidean matrix as a measure of spatial proximity among pairs of      graves. We project   the results into geographic space and compare the patterns with the expectations derived from the two research hypotheses. The evaluation of results allows us to reject both hypotheses and formulate a new model of spatial organization based on a few contemporary subsections of the cemetery used by different corporate groups. Finally, the potential of computer-aided modeling of matrices and graphs is discussed in context of other analytical techniques used for the      investigation of intracemetery   mortuary variability.}

  abstract = "Early Bronze Age society in Central Europe is often depicted as a society dominated by males. It is suggested that archaeological evidence is not always in agreement with this view. This study reports the analysis of mortuary variability at the Early Bronze cemetery Rebešovice in Moravia (Czech Republic) that uses computer-intensive resampling techniques. The results indicate that there are only minor differences in the mortuary treatment of females and males. There is neither a    qualitative restriction of body treatment and objects buried with males, nor a quantitative emphasis on burials of males. In fact, burials of females are equipped with a higher number of bronze artifacts. Funerals of females were at least as significant social events as the funerals of males. We argue that the model of a male dominated community that used this cemetery is unwarranted. These findings do not refute the existence of gender-specific activities and roles that may be valued    differently, but instead suggest that both females and males had access to resources from which they could draw power."

abstract = {Second order characteristics, in particular Ripley's K-function, are widely used for the statistical analysis of point patterns. We examine a third order analogue, namely the mean number T(r) of r-close triples of points per unit area. Equivalently this is the expected number of r-close point pairs in an r-neighbourhood of the typical point. Various estimators for this function are proposed and compared, and we give an explicit formula for the isotropic edge correction. The theoretical value of T seems to be unobtainable for most point process models apart from the homogeneous Poisson process. However, simulation studies show that the function T discriminates well between different types of point processes. In particular it detects a clear difference between the Poisson process and the Baddeley–Silverman cell process whereas the K-functions for these processes coincide.},

We go on to summarize and discuss the results of our collective research relating to the ancestry of the Vedrovice community, the health condition, palaeodemography and nutrition of its inhabitants, their social status and social differentiation, and the transmission of cultural traditions inter-generationally and through contact as the major vehicle of culture change that brought about the development of the LBK culture. We go on to reconstruct life biographies of selected individuals from Vedrovice community in order to illustrate the personal diversity and variability of those who made up the Vedrovice community, and to emphasize that we can, through a combination of biological and cultural analyses, within the bioarchaeological approach and through biosocial archaeology, reconstruct life histories of people who died long ago. At a theoretical level, we stress that it is individuals and their life-long history and experience that collectively create communal histories and transform cultural traditions, leading to cultural innovations that the LBK represents. We conclude that Vedrovice was, in all likelihood, a Neolithic "gateway community", both receiving individuals from afar and maintaining long-distance, extra-regional contacts, and also contributing through out-migration to the generation of other LBK communities in Bohemia.},

  abstract = {Many ideas about post-marital residence rules in the society of the first farmers in the European temperate zone (Linear Pottery Culture, ca. 5500–4900 cal BC) have been proposed. The prevailing hypothesis is patrilocality and community exogamy, based on strontium isotope, modern DNA, ancient DNA, linguistic and anthropological evidence. However, presenting several different anthropological models and comparing them with strontium isotope results from two LBK cemeteries (Vedrovice and Nitra), we argue that other post-marital residence rules such as ambilocality, avunculocality, shifting residence or predominant matrilocality were also possible. Arguments set in contradiction to one-sided interpretation of strontium isotope results include a possible practice of polygyny, abduction of young women and non-inhumation burials. A hypothetical model combining patrilocality and matrilocality on different social and geographical levels is proposed.},

  abstract  = {An important issue in the study of cities is defining a metropolitan area, because different definitions affect conclusions regarding the statistical distribution of urban activity. A commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), based on rules attempting to capture the notion of city as a functional economic region, and it is performed by using experience. The construction of MSAs is a time-consuming process and is typically done only for a subset (a few hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a method to designate metropolitan areas, denoted {\textquotedblleft}City Clustering Algorithm{\textquotedblright} (CCA). The CCA is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat{\textquoteright}s law of proportional growth, which postulates that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities are constant, independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a cluster by utilizing the CCA exhibits deviations from Gibrat{\textquoteright}s law, and that the standard deviation decreases as a power law with respect to the city size. The CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations, which are shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in population growth. These results have sociopolitical implications, for example, for the location of new economic development in cities of varied size.},
